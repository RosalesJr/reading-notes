Class 2 reading notes

Hello everyone! My name is Luis Rosales (He/Him) from El Paso, TX, currently serving in the US Army. I am so thankful for the opportunity to be able to attend this course. Currently I posses very little experience in Python. But I am excited to learn as much as possible to pursue my career change as a software engineer. I look forward to meeting everyone tomorrow. My operating system in Windows 10 Pro/ chrome.
