# Class 6 Reading Notes

## Why these topics matter
These topics matter because they are higher advanced skills that improve on what we already know. These topics also make our code easier to read.

### JavaScript Object Basics

- **How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**
Objects in JavaScript are basically like a item in the real word. A item in the real world has its own properties and type just as a object does in JS. For example a laptop, which has its own brand, year made and model.

- **What are some advantages to creating object literals?**
Object literals are good for namespacing and singletons, when you create multiple instances of an object with shared behaviors and are easier to read. Also objects are used by many plugins.

- **How do objects differ from arrays?**
Objects differ from arrays because they have string values that they can use to access it. Unlike arrays who work in a matter like a list.

- **Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**
You would use a bracket notation when you have any property name that is not a valid JavaScript identifier. Since you cannot use dot notation for this. A property name that starts with a number or that is held inside a variable can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.

- **Evaluate the code below. What does the term 'this' refer to and what is the advantage to using 'this'?**
In the following code 'this' refers to the name and age values of the object dog. The advantage of using 'this' is you can refer and call to the current object or objects at hand.

### Itroduction To The DOM

- **What is the DOM?**
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents, representing the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content.

- **Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**
While DOM is not a programming language, JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts without it.
