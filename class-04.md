# Class 4 Reading NOTES

## Why These Topics Matter

These topics matter because these are skills all the great webpages use. Nobody wants to see just a generic webpage anymore. These technics will have any webpage looking and interacting better with and for the user.

### Creating Hyperlinks

- **To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**
The '< a>' element

- **The href attribute contains what information?**
The href attribute will contain the web address

- **What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**
There are many ways that we can ensure our links are accessible to all readers one way is by applying descriptive link text. Other few ways are by including keywords in your link text to describe what it is being linked to, or providing links out of context.

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

- **What is meant by “normal flow”?**
Normal Flow is the way a block or elements are displayed on a webpage before any changes are made to their layout.

- **What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**
They are a few differences between block level and inline elements. For example block level elements fill the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows with the block dimension. While inline elements are just the size of their content. You can't set the width or the height on inline elements. If you want to control the size of an inline element, you need to make it act like a block level element.

- **___ positioning is the default for every html element.**
Static positioning is the default for every html element.

- **Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**
Absolute positioning has a few advantages. For example elements with absolute positioning no longer exists in the normal document flow. What does this mean? It means it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. Why would this be useful? It's useful because it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the webpage. Another advantage of absolute positioning is you can specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides. Instead of positioning the element based on its relative position.

- **What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**
The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. While fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

### Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

- **Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**
With function declaration you are actually creating the function. While with function invocation you are running it or invoking.

- **What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**
Nothing parameters are sometimes called arguments, attribute or even properties.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- **Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

1. Learning from fellow students: I think I would benefit a lot from learning with a fellow student. Because I am still new to coding and I feel working with someone would help me learn new ways to approach a specific problem. Also if i'm the driver in the group hearing my navigator use the industry vocabulary will help me understand the language better.
2. Work environment readiness: The second benefit of how pair programming would help is work environment readiness. It would get me familiar with how pairing works, so I can hit the ground running at my new job. Worry only about producing products and improving my code, not how to work with a partner.
