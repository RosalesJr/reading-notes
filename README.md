# My Reading Notes

I am Luis Rosales. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I'm currently 26 years old and for the past 7 years I have been serving in the United States Army as a mechanic and recovery operator. Now I am looking to make a career switch into the tech world as a software engineer. As of June 27, 2022 I have been attending Code Fellows to make that happen. Some hobbies of mine include exercising, working on cars and of course coding!
