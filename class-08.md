### Learn CSS- Flexbox

- **Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**
Flexbox being designed for one-dimensional content means it won't setup rigid dimensions for the broweser to follow. Instead it will collect all the different size items and return the best layout for them.

- **Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**
The difference between the main axis and the cross axis is, the cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis. For example if your main axis is running horizantally the cross axis will be running vertically.

- **How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**
Since flexbox only reorders the visual order and not the logical order a screen reader will not properly read out the content.

### CSS Layout- Flexbox

- **What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**
Floats are limiting while flexbox is not. Flexbox are also more convenient when adjusting these :

1. Vertically centering a block of content
2. Making all children in a conatainer take up equal space
3. making columns into a multiple-column

- **How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**
It connects with my long term goal because I struggle a lot with the alignment of my objects using CSS. Flexbox can help me in that aspect greatly.
