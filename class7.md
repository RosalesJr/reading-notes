# JavaScript Programming 

## Control Flow

**Control flow** is the order that the computer executes statements on a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

## Conditional

A **condition** is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether it is complete or not. An instruction or a set of instructions will be executed if a specific condition is met,if not another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction, or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet met.

## Loop

**Loops** are a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is met. An example would be the process of getting an item of data and changing it, and then making sure some condition is met such as, if a counter has reached a designated number.

## Functions

**Functions** are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. A **function definition consists of the function key work and is followed by one of these:

- The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}

## Operators

**JavaScript** has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, which is the conditional operator. Binary operators require two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator. Here are some of the type of operators:

- **Assignment operators**(assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand)

- **Comparison operators**(compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true)

- **Arithmetic operators**(takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value)

- **Bitwise operators**( treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers)

- **Logical operators**(typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value)
