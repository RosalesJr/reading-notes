# Git Intro

**Git** in my words is the sport of coding. It is a **DVCS** that stores data in file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a project it is caled a commit. If a file has not changed, Git will store and identical version of it. With Git you can import or push out data from the web.

## Git command examples:

- git add .- stages and tracks all files

- git status- displays information regarding changes to be committed

- git commit -m""- adds a message to the changes and record you did

- git push origin main- pushes changes from local branch to the remote respository
