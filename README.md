# My Reading Notes Journal!

##  **This is where I'm going to store my reading notes.** 

**Growth Mindsent** is having the willpower to continue past failure, knowing you will succeed through practice and being comfortable with being uncomfortable. It is being a life long learner and embracing the unknown.


### _Reminders to stay in mindset:_
- enjoy the journey, trust the process and welcome the challenges 
- the best in their fields were the ones who failed the most and kept going
- challenges are like exercising the more you practice it the easier the challenge becomes
