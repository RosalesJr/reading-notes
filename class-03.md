# Class 03 Reading Notes

## Why These Topics Matter
These topics matter because they build upon the basics. Also can cut time off your code and make life easier. Such as using arrays or assignment operators.

## Ordered and Unordered lists

- **When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**
You should use a ul element when you want to group a stack of items that don't have a meaning in what order you list them or no numerical order.

- **How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**
To change the bullet style of a list of items you need to use the following attributes: circle, disc, square or css list style type properties. There is a fourth attribute which is triangle but not all browsers support it.

- **When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?**
You should use an ordered list when the order of the stack of items has meaning. For example when listing ingredients in increasing proportions, directions to a destination or a recipe. The oposite will be for unordered list. You would use a UL when you want to group a stack of items that don't have a meaning in what order you list them or no numerical order.

- **Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**
They are many ways to change the numbers on your list items. Here are a few:
- a: for lowercase letters
- i: for lowercase Roman numerals
- 1: for numbers  to be default
Example: < ol type = "i">

## The Box Model

- **Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**
This is the story of "The Box Model" or "The Universe". They are four main characters in this story. First character is "Earth" also called the "content box" who is the main character. This holds the content or humans. Then there's the second character called "atmosphere" or the "padding box". Padding box sits around the "content box" aka "Earth", providing space between "content box" and our third character "border box". Border box or "Orion Arm" wraps around "content box" and "padding box", but he isn't the biggest character. The biggest and last character is "margin box" or the "Milky Way". Every character lives within margin as he is the outermost layer.

- **List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**
There is four parts to an HTML element box:

- Content box- this is the place content is displayed
- Padding box- this is around the content as white space
- Border box- this wraps around the content and padding
- Margin box- the outermost layer, wraps around all the other boxes

## Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops

- **What data types can you store inside of an Array?**
You can store data of any data type in a array. Such as: strings, number, booleans, functions, other arrays or objects.

- **Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**
Yes it is and you can access the value by calling people. Example: console.log(people);

- **List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

- Addition Assignment: x+= f() which means x = x +f()
- Left shift Assignment: x <<= f() which means x = x << f()
- Logical Nullish Assignment: x ??= f() which means x ?? (x = f())
- Bitwuse and Assignment: x &= f() which means x = x  & f()
- Remainder Assignment: x %= f() which means x = x % f()

- **Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**
Result would be false because of the value of C

- **Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**
To determine age of indviduals and if they are adults or kids

- **Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**
A loop is useful in JavaScript when you want to ensure a guest visiting your site answers your prompt question.
