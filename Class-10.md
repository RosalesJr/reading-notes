# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Why These Topics Matter

These topics matter because they can save you great time in trying to debugg your code.

### What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

- **Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
A syntax error occurs due to a fault in your code like misspelling . A logical error occurs due to a fault in the algorithm, the syntax might be correct but the code isn't what you thought it was. Giving incorrect results.

- **List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
Most of my errors in the past have been syntax errors. I be writing the code as fast as I can and always miss a ; or , or something causing my code to break. I have resolved these by taking my time and going back over my code double checking everything.

- **How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?** 
This topic has influenced me a lot because before I didn't know there was a difference in errors. Now I can debugg more precisly knowing exactly what kind of error I have and what to look for.

### The JavaScript Debugger

- **How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
The JavaScript debugger tool is basically your personal detective for your code. You can even set breakpoints in your code to identify the problems that are preventing your code from executing.

- **Define what a breakpoint is.**
Breakpoints are places in your code that you can set to pause execution. Helping identify problems that may be preventing your code from executing. 

- **What is the call stack?**
A call stack shows you what code was executed in order to get to the current line.
